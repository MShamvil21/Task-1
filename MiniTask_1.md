# Project 1- Line Follower Robot (Without Microcontroller)
#### Purpose-IR based line follower robot from scratch
#### Topic-Electronics
This project is totally based on electronics no programming and coding is required. Based on the concept of reflection of infrared rays and Infrared rays are totally absorbed by black colored surfaces .The IR receiver has to be reverse biased. The reflected IR needs to be amplified and IC358 is use to built the amplifier and voltage comparator. Voltage divider is build using the receiver diode and a 10k resistor. Now the sensors are connected with motors using  IC L293D(Connecting the sensors directly with motors  will destroy the circuit since large current is required to run motors).A suitable power supply is connected to the bot preferably 18650 Lithium ion battery.

# Project 2-CO2 Level Indicator-Anti Covid-19 Measure
#### Purpose- A device to measure CO2 Concentration
#### Topic- Microcontrollers

This device will help us to maintain proper ventilation in room which is one of the important aspect in stopping the spread of Covid -19.This device is built around Adafruit Feather328P(other than this any similar similar Arduino Microcontroller can be use).Adafruit Featherwing OLED is used to display the concentration along with date and time, it contains a small OLED screen which communicates through I2C and one more reason for using this particular model is that it contains 3 buttons which are use to interact with device interface. Featherwing Adalogger is used to save the concentration data in SD card this component is a combination of I2C RTC and SPI SD card reader. A  Gravity CO2 sensor is use to measure the gas concentration and LED to use to indicate the level. After connecting all the components code is uploaded using Arduino IDE.

# Project 6- Glove Control Robotic Hand
#### Purpose-To build a fully functional Robotic Hand that can be controlled by glove with flex sensors.
#### Topic-Arduino and Flex Sensors
Robotic hand finger is constructed using foam, springs,tape and string. The arm base contains 5 servo motors which are responsible for finger movements, arduino and breadboard is also embedded in the base of robotic arm. The 5 servo motors are powered by a separate battery for smooth functioning. After organizing all the components and configuring them robotic hand is ready. Now for building glove controller flex sensors are the most important part and purchasing them will increase the budget so rather than buying them it’s possible to DIY them(https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=303&v=SJNYbSpvlP8&feature=emb_logo). Once we are done with the flex sensors we need to upload the code but coding for this project is bit difficult.
We can make the experience better better by using 3-d printed materials and purchasing flex sensors.

# Project 7-Social Distancing Cap
#### Purpose-To modify a cap which can notify us when someone from backside approaches and crosses social distancing limit
#### Topic- Arduino Nano 
The mechanism behind the project is that we have a ultrasonic sensor at the backside of cap and if someone (from backside ) approaches and crosses the social distancing limit  then the servo motor starts rotating gently from 0 to 180 and falls back to 0 to get your attention. The coding for the project is simple but its application are also limited .

One more shortcoming of this project is that when a person of short height will approach the ultrasonic sensor may not be able to detect it properly for that we have to adjust the sensor so that it can cover the person shorter in height.

# Project 8- Incognito Glasses
#### Purpose-To block out your face from any security camera that does not have IR filter
#### Topic- Microcontroller and IR LED
This project is build around DigiSpark Microcontroller (Other microcontroller can also be use, this microcontroller is use to minimize cost).This device cannot block our you face if camera is having IR filter in this case you will see a small red or purple light coming from LED. High brightness of LED is must for complete block out and for that MOSFET transistor is use to amplify voltage. To avoid power loss while connecting and disconnecting battery switch is introduce.

A 9 V battery will increase the weight of glasses so to avoid that batteries with smaller size and same capacity should be used.

# Project 9- Car Tracker (GPS less)
#### Purpose- To build a device that can track my car location.
#### Topic-WeMos D1 Mini
When we usually think of location tracking we mostly think of some microcontroller with a GPS which can plot the path. But in this device we used a rarely known way Wifi Geolocation and Google provide such service. The Device will send a list of Wifi access point from a location  to Google’s API and it will return the GPS coordinate for that point.GPS coordinate can be use to trace the path. D1 mini is use to host a web server that will provide us with history of all trips and their path maps. You need to get an API key from Google and have geolocation service enabled in it to run the device. For the hardware part WeMos D1 mini is connected to two modules SD card and a Real Time Clock (RTC).SD card is use to save the trip files and the RTC is use to timestamp the trip.

# Project 12- Automatic Plant Irrigation System
#### Purpose-A system to irrigate plants without human interference
#### Topic- HEX inverter and NE555 timer
This system is based on the concept that soil has very high resistance when it is dry and very low resistance when it is wet. Two probes are inserted into the soil and voltage is given by battery connected to the circuit. When the soil is dry HEX inverter will get the input low and convert it to high and trigger the first NE555 timer which will trigger the second NE555 timer and eventually electrically operated valve will open and allow the water to flow. After the soil becomes wet it will give high input to HEX inverter which will pass low output to rest of the system and water flow will stop.
