# Project 1- Line Follower Robot (Without Microcontroller)
#### Purpose-IR based line follower robot from scratch
#### Topic-Electronics
This project is totally based on electronics no programming and coding is required. Based on the concept of reflection of infrared rays and Infrared rays are totally absorbed by black colored surfaces .The IR receiver has to be reverse biased. The reflected IR needs to be amplified and IC358 is use to built the amplifier and voltage comparator. Voltage divider is build using the receiver diode and a 10k resistor. Now the sensors are connected with motors using  IC L293D(Connecting the sensors directly with motors  will destroy the circuit since large current is required to run motors).A suitable power supply is connected to the bot preferably 18650 Lithium ion battery.

# Project 2-CO2 Level Indicator-Anti Covid-19 Measure
#### Purpose- A device to measure CO2 Concentration
#### Topic- Microcontrollers

This device will help us to maintain proper ventilation in room which is one of the important aspect in stopping the spread of Covid -19.This device is built around Adafruit Feather328P(other than this any similar similar Arduino Microcontroller can be use).Adafruit Featherwing OLED is used to display the concentration along with date and time, it contains a small OLED screen which communicates through I2C and one more reason for using this particular model is that it contains 3 buttons which are use to interact with device interface. Featherwing Adalogger is used to save the concentration data in SD card this component is a combination of I2C RTC and SPI SD card reader. A  Gravity CO2 sensor is use to measure the gas concentration and LED to use to indicate the level. After connecting all the components code is uploaded using Arduino IDE.

# Project 3- Dust Monitoring System
#### Purpose- Using IOT to built a Dust monitoring system
#### Topics- Arduino and IOT
An IOT based Dust density monitor which can measure the surrounding dust and send the data through internet ,which can be used to graphically monitor the long term value of dust density in a place. Sharp gp2y1014auOf is a particulate sensor built around IR led and uses light scattering technique   to measure the dust concentration in the surrounding.To make this IOT based Arduino Microcontroller and ESP8266(ESP01) WiFi module for internet connectivity is used .After configuring all the components ,Blynk  app setup is done and code needs to be uploaded .
One suggestion from my side is that a buzzer should be added to warn when the dust concentration is high.

# Project 4-Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor
#### Purpose-To build a pulse oximeter and heart rate monitor using MAX30102 sensor.
#### Topic-Arduino
~~Disclaimer~~: It should be stated that this device is not reliable and accurate enough for medical diagnosis. Fun Project to show off the capabilities of Arduino and few other components!!

MAX30102 sensor is used which uses a technique called photoplethysmography to monitor the heart rate. The results are displayed on I2C OLED screen. After connecting the sensor and OLED screen with the arduino ,code is uploaded and green and red led  indicates the range of your SP02 level.

# Project 5-Illuminexa (Homemade Alexa with ESP32)
#### Purpose-To build a device that reacts to your voice and show what you ask for .
#### Topic-ESP32 and Voice Recognition Module
This project uses Voice Recognition Module V3 to communicate which can store upto 80 voice commands each with duration of 1500 milliseconds. A 8x32 neopixel panel is use to display the output in return of the voice command covered by a translucent sheet.ESP32 is powered by Micro USB cable to avoid voltage loses and configured with the led panel and voice recognition module. Before using the voice recognition module, first we need to train it with the commands that we are going to use (There is no language barrier!!).

# Project 6- Glove Control Robotic Hand
#### Purpose-To build a fully functional Robotic Hand that can be controlled by glove with flex sensors.
#### Topic-Arduino and Flex Sensors
Robotic hand finger is constructed using foam, springs,tape and string. The arm base contains 5 servo motors which are responsible for finger movements, arduino and breadboard is also embedded in the base of robotic arm. The 5 servo motors are powered by a separate battery for smooth functioning. After organizing all the components and configuring them robotic hand is ready. Now for building glove controller flex sensors are the most important part and purchasing them will increase the budget so rather than buying them it’s possible to DIY them(https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=303&v=SJNYbSpvlP8&feature=emb_logo). Once we are done with the flex sensors we need to upload the code but coding for this project is bit difficult.
We can make the experience better better by using 3-d printed materials and purchasing flex sensors.

# Project 7-Social Distancing Cap
#### Purpose-To modify a cap which can notify us when someone from backside approaches and crosses social distancing limit
#### Topic- Arduino Nano 
The mechanism behind the project is that we have a ultrasonic sensor at the backside of cap and if someone (from backside ) approaches and crosses the social distancing limit  then the servo motor starts rotating gently from 0 to 180 and falls back to 0 to get your attention. The coding for the project is simple but its application are also limited .

One more shortcoming of this project is that when a person of short height will approach the ultrasonic sensor may not be able to detect it properly for that we have to adjust the sensor so that it can cover the person shorter in height.

# Project 8- Incognito Glasses
#### Purpose-To block out your face from any security camera that does not have IR filter
#### Topic- Microcontroller and IR LED
This project is build around DigiSpark Microcontroller (Other microcontroller can also be use, this microcontroller is use to minimize cost).This device cannot block our you face if camera is having IR filter in this case you will see a small red or purple light coming from LED. High brightness of LED is must for complete block out and for that MOSFET transistor is use to amplify voltage. To avoid power loss while connecting and disconnecting battery switch is introduce.

A 9 V battery will increase the weight of glasses so to avoid that batteries with smaller size and same capacity should be used.

# Project 9- Car Tracker (GPS less)
#### Purpose- To build a device that can track my car location.
#### Topic-WeMos D1 Mini
When we usually think of location tracking we mostly think of some microcontroller with a GPS which can plot the path. But in this device we used a rarely known way Wifi Geolocation and Google provide such service. The Device will send a list of Wifi access point from a location  to Google’s API and it will return the GPS coordinate for that point.GPS coordinate can be use to trace the path. D1 mini is use to host a web server that will provide us with history of all trips and their path maps. You need to get an API key from Google and have geolocation service enabled in it to run the device. For the hardware part WeMos D1 mini is connected to two modules SD card and a Real Time Clock (RTC).SD card is use to save the trip files and the RTC is use to timestamp the trip.
